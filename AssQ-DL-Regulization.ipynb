    "\n",

    "\n",
    "L1 Regularization: Similar to L2 regularization, L1 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function. \n",
    "However, in this case, the penalty is based on the absolute values of the weights. L1 regularization can \n",

    "Dropout: Dropout is a technique where, during training, randomly selected neurons are \"dropped out\" of\n",
    "the network for a given iteration. This prevents the network from relying too heavily on any individual \n",
    "neuron and encourages the network to learn more robust features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Augmentation: Data augmentation involves applying random transformations to the training data,\n",
    "such as rotations, flips, and crops. This artificially increases the diversity of the training data \n",

    "When selecting a regularization technique for a deep learning task, several considerations and \n",
    "tradeoffs come into play, each impacting the model's performance, training speed, and generalization ability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dataset Size: With smaller datasets, simpler regularization methods like L2 or L1 regularization \n",
    "might be preferred, as they add controlled complexity to the model. Larger datasets can benefit \n",
    "from more complex methods like Dropout, as they have sufficient data to support training the larger network.\n",

    "Model Complexity: If your model is already simple, adding more complexity might not be necessary.\n",
    "On the other hand, if your model is large, complex, or prone to overfitting, techniques like Dropout \n",
    "and Batch Normalization can help stabilize training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type of Data: Different techniques may work better with different types of data. For instance,\n",
    "CNNs for image data often benefit from Dropout, while Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) might require \n",
    "specialized techniques like recurrent Dropout or gradient clipping.\n",

    "Interpretability: If model interpretability is essential, simpler methods like L1 regularization might\n",
    "be preferred, as they encourage sparse solutions and feature selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Computation Cost: Techniques like Dropout can introduce extra computational overhead during training due \n",
    "to the stochastic nature of dropout. L2 regularization and Batch Normalization are computationally cheaper alternatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "Training Time: Complex regularization methods can slow down the convergence rate of training, requiring \n",
    "more epochs to reach optimal performance. Faster training may be favored for time-sensitive applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensemble Methods: Techniques like Dropout and Monte Carlo Dropout can be seen as creating ensembles of models. \n",
    "If ensembling is a primary goal, these techniques might be chosen.\n",
    "\n",
    "Architecture Type: Different architectures might benefit from specific techniques. For instance, Convolutional \n",
    "Neural Networks (CNNs) often use Dropout in fully connected layers, while Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) might\n",
    "apply dropout between recurrent layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuning Hyperparameters: The regularization strength, dropout rate, batch size, etc., need to be tuned.\n",
    "Cross-validation or grid search can help find optimal values.\n",
